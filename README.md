## Tutorial Project for Automated Testing Using "PageObject" and "PageElement" 
### Description:
The framework uses examples of different presentation models for web pages: "PageObject" and "PageElement".
### Applied technology:
- Language: Java 1.8
- Build Automation Tool: Maven
- Frameworks: JUnit 5
- Drivers used: Selenium
- Test website: demowebshop.tricentis.com
### Features:
- Separating Test Implementation and Test Specification
- Separating fixtures from tests
- Separating BOM layers
- Launching the browser in normal and non-graphical mode
- Run on Unix and Windows operating systems
- Element highlighting when interacting
## Installation and launch
- Copy the repository
- Add project to IDE
- Run command:
```sh
mvn test
```
To run tests on Unix, you need to run the command for the "/unix/chromedriver" file:
```sh
chmod u+x chromedriver
```
